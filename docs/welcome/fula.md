## How does it work?

To become a truly viable alternative to Big Tech cloud storage, we need to guarantee:

  * reliability

  * availability

  * security

To guarantee reliability, availability, and security, we designed a system that utilizes an already existent decentralized web.

The Fula network is peer-to-peer architecture designed with open protocols and specifications such as [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/), [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and [decentralized identity](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

This allows us to achieve an unprecedented level of interoperability and makes every participant in the ecosystem future proof, including DApp developers.

By developing on the Fula platform, you earn $FULA from your open-source contributions. At the same time, you avoid locking yourself in to a single platform with proprietary APIs and archaic approval processes.

By decoupling data from the application, DApp developers can focus on providing rich user experiences without having to worry about what happens to customer data.

It also means Blox customers will not be locked in to using any one, single DApp.

The Fula network provides a free, open market for service providers.  Box customers are not just consumers; they can become producers within this new ecosystem too.

In short, it's a positive sum protocol for everyone.
