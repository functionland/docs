You've heard of a network attached storage (NAS), but you haven't heard of a blockchain attached storage (BAS).

There is currently no modular, open-source, datacenter-grade server hardware option available.  Hardware that is fully customizable and aesthetically appealing enough to sit comfortably in your home.

Which is why we are creating just that!

## Hardware

ARM-based single board computers (SBCs) have grown in popularity and performance. They consume a fraction of the energy that typical home NAS servers do and perform just as good. We have two models currently in user's hands. The **FxBlox Lite** and **FxBlox Lite Plus**. 

| FxBlox Lite | FxBlox Lite Plus  |
|     :-:     |         :-:       |
|  Unavailable |     $400     |
| Raspberry Pi CM4  | Rockchip RK3588 |
|  8GB RAM   | 8/32GB RAM  |
|  16GB EMMC | 16GB EMMC |
|  3 Modular I/O Ports | 3 Modular I/O Ports |
|  NVMe support | NVMe support |
|  Dual 4K | Dual 4K |
|  Wifi 6 | Wifi 6 |

As the name implies, the Plus model is a more powerful unit, which is a direct result of the upgraded CPU, the Rockchip RK3588!

As for storage, the FxBlox is compatible with most storage types via usb-c cable or adapter. It also has a single slot for an internal M.2 NVMe drive. 

## BAS for Web2

We aim to offer a cloud service that will enable FxBlox owners and non-owners to use decentralized cloud storage just as easily as with big cloud companies. 

Each individual FxBlox owner will be able to help provide storage to the network by adding more as they scale. And we will be able to horizontally scale, by getting the FxBlox into the hands of more people. Together we will be able to grow into a truly people-owned internet!

For non-technical people who want to join the movement by providing storage, we make it easy to set up your device with a simple app. 

For everyday people who want to take advantage of the low-cost decentralized storage, we created two apps that people can use to upload their photos, videos, and files!

## Open Source Everything
We want every step of this product to be as open and adoptable as possible. That is why we use all open source technology for hardware design, APIs to add content to network, inter-Blox communications, and of course blockchain.

To enable this infrastructure, we utilize [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/) for data transfer, data replication, and security in immutability.

We layer [WNFS](https://fission.codes/ecosystem/wnfs/) on top to enable encryption over IPFS, public and private file sharing, as well as decentralized authentication and identity.

We are a [layer two blockchain](https://chain.link/education-hub/what-is-layer-2) utilizing the Polygon and Ethereum networks.
