What we are missing in the web2 (and web3) space is a freemium option for consumers to compute on and store larger sets of data.

### Blox Hardware

ARM-based single board computers (SBCs) have grown in popularity and performance. They consume a fraction of the energy that typical home NAS servers do and perform just as good. We have two models currently in user's hands. The **FxBlox Lite** and **FxBlox Lite Plus**. 

| FxBlox Lite | FxBlox Lite Plus  |
|     :-:     |         :-:       |
|  Unavailable |     $400     |
| Raspberry Pi CM4  | Rockchip RK3588 |
|  8GB RAM   | 8/32GB RAM  |
|  16GB EMMC | 16GB EMMC |
|  3 Modular I/O Ports | 3 Modular I/O Ports |
|  NVMe support | NVMe support |
|  Dual 4K | Dual 4K |
|  Wifi 6 | Wifi 6 |

As the name implies, the Plus model is a more powerful unit, which is a direct result of the upgraded CPU, the Rockchip RK3588!

As for storage, the FxBlox is compatible with most storage types via usb-c cable or adapter. It also has a single slot for an internal M.2 NVMe drive.
