# Welcome to Functionland

Functionland was founded on a core set of Web3 principles. At the heart of these principles is a simple premise: **<u>We each have an inalienable right to own our own data.</u>**

We set out to build a better future around this simple premise. We started by developing an app that liberates a set of "own data" we think is particularly important to people: personal home photos and video.
We also provide and ipfs compatible pinning service, which is the first true decentralized pinning service for ipfs data
