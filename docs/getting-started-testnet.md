# Getting Started with FxBlox

Welcome to the world of FxBlox! This guide will walk you through the essentials to get your FxBlox device up and running smoothly.

## 1. Equipment Needed
To get started, you'll need the following equipment:
- A 25W PD2 compatible power adapter
- A USB thumb stick (4GB to 32GB) for initial setup
- An adapter from USB-C to USB-A (to connect the thumb stick to the blox)
- External storage device like SSDs, HDDs, and more
- For CM4 bloxes: external storage as mentioned above or [framework expansion cards](https://frame.work/marketplace/expansion-cards)
- For RK1 bloxes: internal m.2 nvme drive, external storage as mentioned above, or [framework expansion cards](https://frame.work/marketplace/expansion-cards)
- Optional: USB-C to ethernet adaptors and USB-C to HDMI for additional connectivity

Functionland does not get any kickback or royalties from the sale of Framework expansion cards. We recommend them because we designed the FxBlox case and modularity around their small form factor standard.

## 2. Identifying Your Blox
It is important you know which FxBlox you have before you move onto the setup stage! It will determine which route you follow, how you get support, and what software is compatible with your device. Checkout the [How To Identify Your FxBlox](/functionyard/hardware/fxblox-hardware) guide to learn more!
