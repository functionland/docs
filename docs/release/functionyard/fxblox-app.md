## Installing the FxBlox App

### Initial Setup

1. **Download the App**: 
   - For Android: [FxBlox on Google Play (v1.5.5+)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=land.fx.blox).
   - For iOS: Available soon on the App Store.
2. **Metamask Wallet**: Ensure you have a [Metamask wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metamask) for setting up your identity.

### App Configuration Steps

1. Open Metamask Wallet and it is better if you put it on "Ethereum Mainnet" (Mainnet which is usually the default and not Testnet)
2. Minimize Metamask (not close) and open the Blox app.
3. Read the [Terms and Condition](https://fx.land/terms) and if you agree, then Select "Agree and Setup Blox" in the app.
4. Enter a memorable password for data encryption and click "Sign" (Note: This is not your Metamask password).
5. Complete the connection in the Metamask app, then return to the FxBlox app.
   - You may need to click back to manually return to the app if it does not open Blox automatically after you sign in Metamask)
   - It does not matter which chain you are on, in your Metamask wallet.
6. Tap "Connect to new blox".
7. Manually connect your phone to the "FxBlox" WiFi, and turn off "mobile data", then continue in the app.
8. Attach at least 500GB of external storage to your FxBlox. Proceed by clicking "Next" once the app recognizes the storage.
   - If the storage is not recognized ensure that is it correctly formatted.
   - If you have an FxBlox version with internal storage, there is no need to attach external storage
10. Select your desired WiFi network for the FxBlox and enter the password.
11. Finally, on the last screen reconnect your mobile device to your home WiFi and you can turn on the mobile data again if you want to. The app will confirm the successful setup. Please note the app does not continue if you do not have an active internet connection. When Blox is connected to the internet, the LEDs turn `green` for 30 seconds and then turn off.
12. We recommend unplugging and replugging the Blox after the initial setup once for a hard reboot and ensuring that everything is set. After you re-plug the power and it boots, it may reboot automatically once as well.

### Troubleshooting

- <b>If Metamask doesn't redirect:</b> Manually go back to the FxBlox app.
- <b>App issues with Metamask:</b> On some phones if you cannot get the "Connect" and "sign" prompts in Metamask, you may need to put both the Metamask app and Blox app in Unrestricted mode from the "Battery Optimization". follow: `Settings` > `Apps` > `FxBlox` (and also for `Metmask`) > `Battery` / `App Battery` > Choose `Unrestricted`. After the setup, you can return it back to the default of `Optimized`
- <b>Final step connection issues:</b> Restart FxBlox and retry. If unresolved, restart the FxBlox app.
