## Joining the Testnet
:::warning 
If you have setup FxBlox **before** official testnet launch, you will be required to format drive to clear out old/incompatible chain data. You can **format the drive after completing setup** and by **click and holding anywhere on the Hard Drive info box** until the pop-up option appears. See more [details here](./fxblox-app.md/#format-drive)
:::

1. In the `FxBlox` App, go to the `Users` Page and click `Join Testnet`
<div class="text--center">
   <img src="/img/fxyard-network/join-testnet.png" style={{width: 500}}/>
</div>
  - Or you can manually visit the testnet page at [Functionyard Testnet](https://fund.functionyard.fula.network) and enter your Indiegogo campaign order details and account id from the Blox app.
  - If the `Account` and `Join` buttons are greyed out, it means the blox is still syncing the chain data. It may take a few minutes to up to a day depending on the speed of the attached USB and internet speed. We will add a more visual indicator of this in future releases.
2. In the FxBlox app, go to `Settings > Pools`. Join a pool nearest to your city. Choose the one closest to you from the list. Please note, that if you choose a pool that is far from you, the request will automatically rejected by the system. 
3. Wait for approval from 5 pool members (may take up to 24 hours right now).
4. Once approved, the pool button changes to "Leave". You can now start storing and earning.
