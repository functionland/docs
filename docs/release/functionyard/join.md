## Joining the Testnet

1. In the `FxBlox` App, go to `Users` Page and click `Join Testnet`
  - Or you can manually visit the testnet page at [Functionyard Testnet](https://fund.functionyard.fula.network) and enter your Indiegogo campaign order details and account id from Blox app.
  - If the `Account` and `Join` buttons are greyed out, it means the blox is still syncing the chain data. It may take a few minutes to up to a day depending on the speed of the attached USB and internet speed. We will add a more visual indicator of this in future releases
3. In the FxBlox app, go to `Settings > Pools`. Join a pool nearest to your city. Choose the one closest to you from the list. Please note, that if you choose a pool that is far from you, the request will automatically rejected by the system. 
4. Wait for approval from 5 pool members (may take up to 24 hours right now).
5. Once approved, the pool button changes to "Leave". You can now start storing and earning.
