What we are missing in the web2 (and web3) space is a freemium option for consumers to compute on and store larger sets of data.

Web2 companies offer you free limited-storage when you make an account with them. In our case, Bloxes will empower that decentralized storage network and offer paid services for more premium features. It is our goal to be as open and for-the-people as possible.

## Blox Hardware

ARM-based single board computers (SBCs) have grown in popularity and performance. They consume a fraction of the energy that typical home NAS servers do and perform just as good. We have two models currently in user's hands, the **FxBlox Lite** and **FxBlox Lite Plus**.

| FxBlox Lite | FxBlox Lite Plus  |
|     :-:     |         :-:       |
|  Unavailable |     $400     |
| Raspberry Pi CM4  | Rockchip RK3588 |
|  8GB RAM   | 8/32GB RAM  |
|  16GB EMMC | 16GB EMMC |
|  3 Modular I/O Ports | 3 Modular I/O Ports |
|  NVMe support | NVMe support |
|  Dual 4K | Dual 4K |
|  Wifi 6 | Wifi 6 |

As the name implies, the Plus model is a more powerful unit, which is a direct result of the upgraded CPU, the Rockchip RK3588!

As for storage, the FxBlox is compatible with most storage types via usb-c cable or adapter. It also has a single slot for an internal M.2 NVMe drive.

## Decentralized Storage
Our very first mission has been to offer decentralized cloud storage for the masses. It comes from our Founders' desire to store photo and video in a more friendly way outside of centralized cloud storage solutions. We have already been making large strides towards realizing this goal. 

**Official testnet launch** of the Fula network is set for **first week of April 2024**. And **mainnet** is scheduled for **end of year 2024**.

## Decentralized Compute
Offering storage for the masses is achievable with the use of apps and webpages, but our FxBloxes are powerful, efficient server-ready devices. Decentralized computation goes deeper than that, offering you the ability to train LLMs on the FxBloxes neural computer units. You could operate a network of Oracles for on-chain events. Or run real-world scientific physics models with the dedicated GPU. 

With FxBlox XLs, owners will not just have upgraded CPUs and I/O, but also Thunderbolt support for external graphics cards.

The FxBlox will create the backbone for the Fula network where both decentralized storage and computation will be accessible to anyone who wants to join.
