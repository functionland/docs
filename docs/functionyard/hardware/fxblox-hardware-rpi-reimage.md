## Re-imaging CM4

If for any reason the CM4 fulatower gets stuck in a blue/white light without going through the whole boot process, or it is not connected to the Wi-Fi or propagating the FxBlox hotspot, you need to perform a full re-image. This process requires you to first open the tower, which involves unscrewing parts of it. The process of opening the tower is shown in the video below:

[![How to open the tower](https://img.youtube.com/vi/feBov6U_kJs/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/feBov6U_kJs?t=246)

### Steps for Re-imaging

1. **Unplug the Tower from Power**

   Ensure the tower is not connected to any power source before proceeding.

2. **Opening the Tower**

   Follow the instructions in the video linked above to open the tower safely.

3. **Connect the USB-C Port**

   Connect the USB-C port on the side of the tower to your laptop or PC.

4. **Short Circuit the Two Pins**

   Short circuit the two pins located on the bottom left side of the Raspberry Pi module. You can use anything to short circuit them, like putting hte head of a USC-C cable between them. but make sure hte material you are using is conductive nad not Aluminum for example (key rings for example are usually aluminum)

5. **Power On the Tower**

   Plug the tower back into power. It should display a blue/white light and remain like that, indicating it is in image mode. You can remove the short circuit from step 4 at this stage.

6. **Installing and Running rpiboot**

   - **For Windows:**
     - Download and install rpiboot from [here](https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/raw/master/win32/rpiboot_setup.exe).
     - Type `rpiboot` in your search bar and run it. After a few seconds it starts printing some stuff and automatically closes after 15 seconds or so. Wait for the terminal to close before proceeding.

   - **For Mac:**
     ```
     git clone --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules --depth=1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot
     cd usbboot
     brew install libusb
     brew install pkg-config
     make
     sudo ./rpiboot
     ```

     After a few seconds it starts printing some stuff and automatically closes after 15 seconds or so. Wait for the terminal to close before proceeding.

7. **Download the Latest Image**

   Download the latest image for your CM4, from [the official GitHub repository](https://github.com/functionland/rpi-image/releases/latest). Download all the files that start with `rpi_cm4_fulimage` into one folder on your computer.

8. **Unzip the Image Content**

   Right click on the one that ends with `.zip.001` and use [7zip application](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) to extract. Extract the contents of the downloaded image to a known location on your computer.

9. **Install and Run Raspberry Pi Imager**

   - **For Windows:** Download from [here](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_latest.exe).
   - **For Mac:** Download from [here](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_latest.dmg).

10. **Configure Raspberry Pi Imager**

    Open Raspberry Pi Imager and select the following:

    - **Raspberry Pi Device:** RASPBERRY PI 4
    - **Operating System:** Scroll down and choose "custom image," then select the `.img` file inside the folder you unzipped in the previous step.
    - **Storage:** Click on "Choose storage" and select the newly added storage, which should be around 30GB and named RPi-Msd.

11. **Start the Imaging Process**

    Click "Next." Choose "No" for the first popup asking if you want custom configs, and "Yes" for the second one asking for confirmation.

12. **Wait for Completion**

    The imaging process might take about 3 hours. Please be patient.

13. **Final Steps**

    After completion, remove the short circuit from the pins, disconnect the USB-C cable connecting the tower to the computer, and then unplug and re-plug the tower to power.

14. **Set Up Using FxBlox App**

    Now that you have the updated fulatower, use the FxBlox app to set it up. There's no need for any other manual updates.

15. **Closing the Tower**

    Once you've confirmed a successful setup through the FxBlox app, close up the tower again to protect it from damage.

- If at the end of setup, you see a message that the app could not connect to Blox, Close the app, unplug and re-plug the blox and wait for 1 minute and open the app.
