## How to request support

No matter what happens we are here to support you as a valued member of Fula network. However, to allow us spend time on development, please first make sure you follow the instructions carefully. I understand reading the documentations can be a boring chore, but that would save your valuable time from troubleshooting.

- In case you still need support please post your question [on our support portal](https://functionland.peeranha.io/)
  
- You can also get the support from community by posting in our [telegram group](https://t.me/fxblox), however, support from the team will only be provided on the support portal.
  
- You can open a support ticket from our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/DKCnSJmbH6)

To ensure we can support everyone, please do not DM or email the individuals in Functionland. We appreciate your cooperation.
