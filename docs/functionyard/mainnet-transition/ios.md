<strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: Save Your Account ID</strong>
<br />
Before updating the application, ensure you have <strong>copied and saved your Blox account ID</strong> from the app. This will not be shown after the update and you'll need it for claiming testnet tokens.
</div>

:::danger Important Notice
iOS requires both Blox device reset AND application reset. Make sure you have your Blox account ID saved before proceeding!
:::

## Step 1: Save Your Account Information

**Before doing anything else:**
1. Open your current FxBlox app
2. Go to account/profile section
3. **Copy and save your Blox account ID**
4. Store it safely - you'll need this for token claiming at [https://claim-ui.fula.network](https://claim-ui.fula.network)

## Step 2: Verify Internet Connection

Ensure your Blox is connected to the internet:

1. Go to **Settings > Blox Discovery** (ensure your iPhone is on the same WiFi network as your Blox)
2. If Blox is connected to internet, the page should show it
3. You can also check from your router admin panel

2. **Plug it back** into power
3. **Watch the LED sequence:**

## Step 4: Update Your iOS App

1. Update your FxBlox app from the App Store to version **2.0.1 or higher**
2. The app will be reset during this process (this is expected)

## Step 5: Setup After Reset

After the Blox starts **flashing cyan** and you've updated the app:

1. Use the updated FxBlox app to set up your Blox
2. Connect it to your internet/WiFi
3. The app should now show **"Connected"**
4. **Wait 2 hours** for the Blox to get fully updated

:::tip Patience Required
The 2-hour waiting period is crucial for the Blox to download and install all necessary updates.
:::

## Step 6: Follow Android Connected Instructions

Once your Blox shows as connected and has been updated for 2 hours, the process is the same as Android:

### Chain Selection
1. Go to **Settings > Chain Selection**
2. Ensure you are on the correct chain (Base/Skale) - default is Skale
3. If you have authorization code, change to Base only if instructed by the team
4. Click **"Add and Switch to Skale/Base"** button (opens MetaMask)
5. In MetaMask, ensure you're on the same chain selected in Blox app

### App Restart
1. **Close both** FxBlox app and MetaMask completely
2. **Re-open** the FxBlox app

### Switch to Mainnet
1. On home screen, click **"Switch to Skale/Base"** button
2. This opens MetaMask - **wait a few seconds**
3. You'll see "Go back to application" message
4. Switch back to FxBlox app
5. The button should disappear

### Join Global Pool
1. Go to **Settings > Pools**
2. Join the **Global pool**
