# New Installation - Mainnet Setup

This guide is for users who are setting up their Blox device for the **first time** and want to start directly on mainnet (skipping testnet).

<div style={{backgroundColor: '#e8f5e8', padding: '15px', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '20px 0'}}>
<strong>âœ… This guide is for you if:</strong>
<ul>
<li>You have a brand new Blox device</li>
<li>You've never joined the testnet</li>
<li>You want to start directly on mainnet</li>
<li>Your FxBlox app is version 2.0.1 or higher</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Step 1: Initial Setup

1. **Download** the FxBlox app from your device's app store
2. Ensure you have version **2.0.1 or higher**
3. **Connect** your Blox device to power and internet using the app setup wizard

:::info Setup Process
Follow the in-app instructions to connect your Blox to your WiFi network. The setup process is guided and straightforward.
:::

## Step 2: Skip Testnet

During the setup process:

1. **Skip joining testnet** when prompted
2. **No need to do anything** related to testnet in the app
3. Simply complete the basic device setup and connection

:::tip Important
You do NOT need to join testnet or configure testnet-related settings. We'll configure everything for mainnet directly.
:::

## Step 3: Wait for Updates

After your Blox shows as **"Connected"** in the app:

1. **Wait approximately 2 hours** for your Blox to download and install updates
2. During this time, your device will automatically update to the latest firmware
3. You can use your phone normally during this waiting period

<div style={{backgroundColor: '#f0f8ff', padding: '15px', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '20px 0'}}>
<strong>ðŸ’¡ Why the wait?</strong>
<br />
Your Blox needs time to download the latest mainnet-compatible firmware and sync with the network. This ensures optimal performance.
</div>

## Step 4: Configure for Mainnet

After the 2-hour waiting period, follow these steps:

### Chain Selection
1. Go to **Settings > Chain Selection**
2. Ensure you are on the correct chain (Base/Skale)
3. Default selection is **Skale** - keep this unless instructed otherwise by the team
4. If you have an authorization code, change to **Base** only if specifically instructed

### Add and Switch Chain
1. Click the **"Add and Switch to Skale/Base"** button
2. This will open MetaMask
3. In MetaMask, ensure you are on the same chain selected in the Blox app

### Restart Apps
1. **Close both** FxBlox app and MetaMask completely
2. **Re-open** the FxBlox app

### Complete Mainnet Switch
1. On the home screen, you'll see a **"Switch to Skale/Base"** button
2. Click on it (opens MetaMask)
3. **Wait a few seconds** on MetaMask
4. You'll see a "Go back to application" message
5. Switch back to the FxBlox app
6. The button should disappear

## Step 5: Join Global Pool

1. Go to **Settings > Pools**
2. Join the **Global pool**

:::success Pool Joining

:::

## Step 6: Verify Success

You should now see:
- **Rewards displayed** on the home page
- A **Claim button** below the rewards when rewards become available
- Your Blox status showing as "Connected"

## Device Compatibility

This process works for both:
- **Android devices** (phones and tablets)
- **iOS devices** (iPhone and iPad)

The steps are identical regardless of your mobile device platform.
