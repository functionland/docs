## Joining the Testnet

1. In the `FxBlox` App, go to the `Users` Page and click `Join Testnet`

</div>
  - Or you can manually visit the testnet page at [Functionyard Testnet](https://fund.functionyard.fula.network) and enter your Indiegogo campaign order details and account id from the Blox app.
  - If the `Account` and `Join` buttons are greyed out, it means the blox is still syncing the chain data. It may take a few minutes to up to a day depending on the speed of the attached USB and internet speed. We will add a more visual indicator of this in future releases.

:::warning 
If you were helping test nightly firmware releases **before** official testnet launch, you will be required to format drive to clear out old/incompatible chain data. **See more [details here.](./fxblox-app.md/#format-drive)**

2. In the FxBlox app, go to `Settings > Pools`. Join a pool nearest to your city. Choose the one closest to you from the list. Please note, that if you choose a pool that is far from you, the request will automatically rejected by the system.

3. Wait for approval from 5 pool members (may take up to 24 hours right now).

4. Once approved, the pool button changes to "Leave". You can now start storing and earning.

## Add Multiple FxBloxes
:::info
If you do not already have all Bloxes added in your app, then checkout [this guide](./fxblox-app.md#add-multiple-fxbloxes) on how to add them.
:::
Every FxBlox is not automatically enrolled in the testnet. The Blox that is showing in the `Blox` tab, is the "Active" Blox which populates the rest of the settings. There are two scenarios that you may fall under.

### Bought during Indiegogo campaign

To add any extra Bloxes to the testnet, you need to:
1. Make sure you have already followed [the steps above](#joining-the-testnet) to add your first Blox to the testnet. 
2. Swipe left/right to display the next Blox you want to add.
3. Go to `Settings` -> `Pool`, select the testnet pool closest to you.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for any following Blox.

### Bought Blox outside of campaign

If you bought a Blox from the available units on the [shop.fx.land](https://shop.fx.land/) or a second-hand resellers site. Then you will need to send a message to sales@fx.land to have your `Blox Account ID` added to testnet backend. You `Blox Account ID` is shown under the `User` Tab after completing setup.

After this has been completed, you will have to wait a couple hours for the testnet to sync and then yo uwill be able to join.
