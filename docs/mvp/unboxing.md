# Unboxing

As a Box owner.
When I first receive my Box and unpackage it.
I find instructions on what to do next.

The instructions tell me to plug the Box in and power it on.

After powering it on and all necessary components have started.
I am told to load the Box Admin DApp on another device.

When I first load the Box Admin DApp.
I am prompted to enter some information about my identity and to create a new administrative password.

After creating my account.
I am redirected to a [Box Admin](./box-admin) dashboard.
