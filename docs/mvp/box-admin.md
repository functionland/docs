# Box Admin

After loading the Box Admin DApp.

I am asked to enter the username and password I created during [Unboxing](./unboxing)

After logging in.

I am presented with a dashboard where I can:

  * update my personal info
  * manage my $FULA token account
  * view a list of Boxes that I own and their resource usage
  * view installed DApps
  * manage private pool
  * manage public pools
  * manage other members of their Box
