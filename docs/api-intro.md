# Fula API

We designed Fula API to help you (a third-party, open-source developer) build other rich and compelling user experiences.

Want to get your hands dirty right away?   Head over to [getting started](api/getting-started).

If you're the kind of person who likes to read the entire manual before starting the engine, then visit the [Fula Reference API](./reference-api).
